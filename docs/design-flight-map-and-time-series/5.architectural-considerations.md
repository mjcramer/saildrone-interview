### 5. **Architectural Considerations**


Kafka ensures data durability and reliability, even in the case of system failures, and enables easy scaling to handle increasing data volumes. Additionally, Kafka allows multiple consumers to access the same data stream, making it easier to feed data into multiple storage systems (e.g., for real-time analytics in Elasticsearch or long-term storage in a time series database) without impacting the original data source. This architecture ensures that transformations can happen at different stages, keeping data ingestion efficient and enabling you to process, enrich, or transform the data flexibly based on downstream needs.





#### 5.1 **Scalability**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Both the ingestion and storage layers are designed for horizontal scalability. Kafka partitions or Kinesis shards can handle increased load by distributing flight data across multiple nodes.
- **Load Balancing**: APIs are deployed behind a load balancer (e.g., Nginx or AWS ALB) to distribute client requests evenly across available nodes.

#### 5.2 **Latency**
- **Low-latency Storage**: The use of Redis and in-memory caching ensures that live flight data can be retrieved within 100 milliseconds. The in-memory data model is optimized for geospatial querying, minimizing the latency of the home screen flight map feature.

#### 5.3 **Fault Tolerance and Data Integrity**

- **Redundancy**: The system replicates data across multiple instances of Redis or the time series database to ensure high availability and prevent data loss in the event of node failure.
- **Backpressure**: The stream processing layer will implement backpressure handling to ensure that the system does not become overwhelmed during periods of high traffic or data volume.
