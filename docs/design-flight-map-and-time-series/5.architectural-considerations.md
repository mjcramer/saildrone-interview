# 5. Architectural Considerations

Summarize section

## 5.1. Scalability

Kafka can be scaled by adding more brokers. More partitions can be added but this is an arduous process

Kafka consumers can be scaled by adding more number of consumer up to the number of partions available in a topic 


Ensure that the Kafka topic (`flights-topic`) is created and configured to handle the required throughput. You might want to configure the topic with multiple partitions to handle large-scale data ingestion effectively.


One way we can scale `Tile38` is by creating multiple instances of the tile38-server and partitioning the data set by flight id. This will ensure that flights all over the world would be spread across a number of partitions evenly. 


### Scaling Considerations:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Tile38's clustering and sharding to scale horizontally, distributing the data across multiple machines.
- **Connection Management**: Manage large-scale query connections using connection pooling.
- **Efficient Queries**: Make use of spatial indexes that Tile38 provides automatically to ensure efficient querying of large datasets.


But what about regional latency (would we need regional replication)
   - **Indexing**: Ensure that the Tile38 server has enough memory and appropriate indexing (which it usually does automatically with geospatial data).
   - **Sharding**: If you are working with millions of queries per second, you can scale Tile38 horizontally using sharding, where you partition the data across multiple Tile38 instances. Each shard handles a portion of the spatial data, and the Python client can query each shard as needed.
   - **Caching**: You may use a caching mechanism (like Redis) to cache results of frequent queries to reduce repeated database hits.
   - **Batching**: If querying very large areas, consider splitting the area into smaller regions (using tiling) and querying each region concurrently for efficiency.
   - **Connection Pooling**: If you're making frequent queries, use connection pooling libraries to minimize connection overhead.

3. **Scalability Considerations**:
   - **Load Balancing**: Use a load balancer in front of multiple Tile38 instances to distribute read and write queries evenly.
   - **Cluster Mode**: Tile38 supports clustering, allowing for better scalability as the number of clients and queries grows.
   - **Redis Replication**: Since Tile38 is compatible with Redis, you can also leverage Redis replication for read scaling by querying replica nodes.

**Potential Extensions**:
- **Error Handling**: You could add more robust error handling and retries in case of Kafka connectivity issues.
- **Batching**: For efficiency, you may want to batch multiple messages together before sending them to Kafka.
- **Enrichment**: If needed, the flight data can be enriched before publishing, for example by adding additional weather or traffic data.

**Conclusion**:
This Python-based Kafka producer service allows you to efficiently ingest flight data in real-time, converting it into JSON format and sending it to Kafka for downstream processing. This setup can scale horizontally by adding more producer instances to handle a higher throughput of flight data ingestion.





## 5.2. Latency


**Low-latency Storage**: The use of Redis and in-memory caching ensures that live flight data can be retrieved within 100 milliseconds. The in-memory data model is optimized for geospatial querying, minimizing the latency of the home screen flight map feature.




## 5.3. Resiliancy


- **Redundancy**: The system replicates data across multiple instances of Redis or the time series database to ensure high availability and prevent data loss in the event of node failure.
- **Backpressure**: The stream processing layer will implement backpressure handling to ensure that the system does not become overwhelmed during periods of high traffic or data volume.

## 5.4. Data Integrity


#### Schema Evolution
This schema can be extended with more fields or attributes (e.g., adding in-flight entertainment data or cabin conditions) as needed without breaking existing processes. This flexibility is key to handling future data requirements or integrating additional data sources.

Tile38 is compatible with Redis in several ways, particularly in terms of its protocol, commands, and client interactions. This compatibility makes Tile38 a great choice if you’re already familiar with Redis or if you want to leverage Redis tools, replication, or clustering to scale Tile38 appropriately. Below are key ways Tile38 is compatible with Redis and how you can leverage this compatibility to scale:


### 1. **Protocol and Client Compatibility:**
   - Tile38 speaks the **Redis RESP protocol** (Redis Serialization Protocol), meaning it works with any Redis client. You can use existing Redis clients in various programming languages to interact with Tile38.
   - Tile38 commands are built upon Redis’s familiar command structure, so if you have experience with Redis, you can easily adapt to Tile38. However, Tile38 extends Redis’s basic functionality by focusing on geospatial data.

   **How to leverage it**:
   - Use **existing Redis clients** and libraries to connect and perform operations on Tile38, making integration easy if you already have Redis in your stack.
   - You can manage Tile38 in environments that already use Redis, simplifying deployment and orchestration across systems that rely on Redis.

### 2. **Replication:**
   - Tile38 supports **Redis-style replication**, which allows you to configure master-slave (primary-replica) setups. In this setup, Tile38 nodes replicate data from the master to one or more replicas, enabling read scalability and failover.
   - Replication in Tile38 is asynchronous, like in Redis. You can set up Tile38 replicas to scale read queries by distributing them across multiple nodes while maintaining a single master for write operations.

   **How to leverage it**:
   - **Read scaling**: Set up **replica nodes** to handle a high volume of read queries while the master node handles writes.
   - **Fault tolerance**: Use replicas for redundancy and failover, ensuring the system remains operational even if the master node fails. In case of failure, you can promote a replica to master.

### 3. **Clustering:**
   - While Tile38 doesn't have native clustering like Redis Cluster, you can **manually shard** your Tile38 instances across multiple nodes or servers. Each node will be responsible for managing a subset of the geospatial data (e.g., using a geohash or partitioning based on geographic regions).
   - You can use **Redis Cluster or a Redis-compatible proxy** to distribute the requests across different Tile38 instances.

   **How to leverage it**:
   - **Manual sharding**: Partition geospatial data logically (e.g., by geographic regions, geohashes, or flight IDs) and distribute these partitions across multiple Tile38 instances. Queries can be routed to the appropriate shard based on the partition key.
   - **Proxy-based scaling**: Use a **Redis-compatible proxy**, like Twemproxy or Redis Cluster, to distribute requests across different Tile38 instances based on geospatial keys. This allows for automatic request routing and load balancing.
   - **Sharding by geospatial region**: Divide the world into different geographic areas (e.g., North America, Europe, etc.) and assign different Tile38 instances to handle data within each region.

### 4. **Pub/Sub and Messaging:**
   - Tile38 supports **Pub/Sub** messaging similar to Redis, allowing clients to subscribe to channels and receive messages when certain events occur, such as geofence triggers.
   - This feature is useful for building real-time systems that react to geospatial events (e.g., when a flight enters or exits a specific geofence).

   **How to leverage it**:
   - Use **geofencing** and the **Pub/Sub** feature to trigger real-time alerts or events when flights enter or leave specified geospatial areas.
   - Use **Redis Streams** for scalable real-time message processing if combining Tile38 with Redis in an event-driven architecture.

### 5. **Persistence and Data Durability:**
   - Like Redis, Tile38 can persist data to disk using **AOF (Append-Only File)** and **snapshots (RDB)**. This allows Tile38 to periodically save in-memory data to disk, ensuring that data is not lost after a restart.
   - You can configure the persistence strategy based on your performance requirements, balancing between high durability (frequent saves) and high performance (less frequent saves).

   **How to leverage it**:
   - Use **AOF persistence** if you need to ensure that all geospatial updates are saved for durability. However, frequent AOF writes can affect performance, so balance it according to your scaling needs.
   - Use **snapshots** (periodic dumps) if performance is the priority, but be aware that some data might be lost after a crash or restart, depending on the snapshot interval.
   - In high-scale setups, you can disable persistence on replicas and rely on the master for data persistence.

### 6. **Redis Tools and Ecosystem:**
   - Since Tile38 is Redis-compatible, you can use a variety of **Redis management tools** (e.g., Redis Sentinel for high availability, RedisInsight for monitoring, etc.) to monitor and manage your Tile38 deployment.
   - Redis monitoring tools can help you optimize Tile38 performance, ensuring you handle millions of queries effectively.

   **How to leverage it**:
   - Use **Redis Sentinel** for automatic failover and high availability of Tile38 instances. If the master Tile38 node goes down, Sentinel can promote a replica to become the new master automatically.
   - Use **Redis monitoring tools** like RedisInsight to monitor the health and performance of your Tile38 cluster, tracking key metrics like memory usage, query times, and replication lag.

### Example: Sharding Tile38 with a Redis Cluster Proxy
Here’s a high-level strategy for scaling Tile38 using Redis clustering concepts:
1. **Shard your data geographically** by dividing the world into zones (e.g., based on geohash or lat/lon ranges).
2. Deploy multiple **Tile38 instances**, each responsible for a specific geographic zone.
3. Use a **Redis Cluster proxy** (like Twemproxy or a custom shard router) to route requests to the correct Tile38 instance based on the region.
4. **Replicate** each Tile38 instance for read scaling and fault tolerance.

This setup ensures that read and write requests are spread across multiple Tile38 instances, increasing throughput and handling a massive number of concurrent geospatial queries.

### Example of Scaling Using Redis Sentinel for Tile38:

```bash
# Set up replication for Tile38
tile38-server --appendonly yes --replicaof <master-ip> <master-port>

# Use Redis Sentinel for failover
redis-sentinel /path/to/sentinel.conf
```

You can configure Sentinel to monitor your Tile38 instances and automatically failover when a master fails, ensuring high availability without downtime.

---

### Conclusion:
Tile38's compatibility with Redis opens up a wide range of options for scaling your geospatial database. By using replication, sharding, Redis Sentinel, and Redis-compatible tools, you can scale Tile38 to handle millions of queries per second, provide fault tolerance, and ensure high availability. By leveraging Redis-like replication and clustering strategies, you can manage large datasets, perform high-speed queries, and scale your geospatial application efficiently.
