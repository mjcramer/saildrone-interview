### 4. **Feature 2: Time Series Flight Data**

#### 4.1 **Data Pipeline**

1. **Ingestion Layer**:
   - The timeseries data stream includes updates for each flight's location, altitude, and airspeed every 5 seconds. These updates are appended to a time series database.

2. **Processing Layer**:
   - The incoming data is pre-aggregated (e.g., min, max, average) to support fast retrieval for timeseries graphs. Historical data is retained for a predefined window (e.g., 24 hours).

3. **Storage Layer**:
   - Use of a time series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) to store historical flight data with high write throughput and optimized for temporal queries.

#### 4.2 **Data Model**

- **Flight Time Series Table**:
  ```
  flight_id (PK) | timestamp (PK) | latitude | longitude | altitude | airspeed
  ```

- **Flight Metadata Table**:
  ```
  flight_id (PK) | airline | flight_number | departure_airport | arrival_airport | aircraft_type
  ```

#### 4.3 **Storage Solution**

- **TimescaleDB or InfluxDB**: These databases are optimized for time series data, allowing for high ingestion rates and efficient querying for historical data. They also support downsampling for older data, reducing storage costs.

#### 4.4 **Query and API Design**

- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/flights/{flight_id}/timeseries?start=<timestamp>&end=<timestamp>`
  - **Request**: The client provides the flight ID and a time range.
  - **Response**: A time series of location, altitude, and airspeed data.

- **Graph Data API**:  
  - Pre-aggregated data (e.g., average altitude per minute) can be queried via the same API, providing data for visualization.
