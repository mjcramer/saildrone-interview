# 3. Feature 1: Live View of Flights

The live view of flights presents a view of all currently active flights within the specific bounds of the user's home screen. This is attained by populating an in-memory database, `Tile38` with continual updates on the current position of each flight as we consume them from the `active_flights` topic in our data pipeline. To update `Tile38` with the current position of all active flights, you can leverage its real-time geospatial capabilities to store and track the locations of flights. `Tile38` works by storing geographic objects, such as points, in a spatial index, and allows for efficient real-time updates and queries on those objects. For each flight, you would store the flight's unique ID along with its current latitude and longitude as a geospatial point. To update the flight's position, the **SET** command is used, which updates or adds a new geospatial object for the flight. This can be done as frequently as needed (e.g., every few seconds) to keep the flight locations current.

For example, to update a flight with ID `flight_123` to a new position with latitude `40.730610` and longitude `-73.935242`, you would issue the following command:
```bash
SET active_flights flight_123 POINT 40.730610 -73.935242
```
This command adds or updates the location of `flight_123` in the `active_flights` collection, using a `POINT` object to represent the geospatial coordinates. This operation would be repeated for each flight data message received from the data pipeline. 

To retrieve a set of flights within a geographic bounding box, you can use Tile38’s **WITHIN** command. The bounding box is defined by two sets of coordinates: the southwest corner (min latitude/longitude) and the northeast corner (max latitude/longitude). This command will return all flights whose positions fall within the specified bounding box. For example, if you want to query for all flights within a bounding box that extends from latitude `40.0` to `41.0` and longitude `-74.0` to `-73.0`, you would run the following command:
```bash
WITHIN active_flights BOUNDS 40.0 -74.0 41.0 -73.0
```
This command queries the `active_flights` collection and returns all flight objects whose geospatial points fall within the given bounding box. `Tile38` efficiently handles these queries at low latency, making it suitable for the user experience required for our feature. 

Our data flow architecture is presented below:

## 3.1. Active Flight Data Update 

Here’s an example of how you would use Python to update the flight positions and retrieve flights within a bounding box:



To send the current flight position from a Protobuf message to a Tile38 database using the Python Tile38 library, you first need to deserialize the Protobuf message, extract the relevant data (latitude, longitude, flight ID, altitude, and airspeed), and store this information into Tile38.



```python
import tile38
from flight_data_pb2 import FlightData

# Initialize Tile38 client
client = tile38.Tile38()

def update_flight(flight_data: FlightData):
    # Store the flight data in Tile38 with altitude, airspeed, and metadata as fields
    # The collection is named `active_flights`, and each flight is stored with its `flight_id`. Fields like altitude and airspeed are stored alongside the geospatial data (latitude and longitude).
    client.set('active_flights', flight_data.flight_id).fields(
        altitude=flight_data.altitude,
        airspeed=flight_data.airspeed,
        airline=flight_data.metadata.airline,
        flight_number=flight_data.metadata.flight_number,
        departure_airport=flight_data.metadata.departure_airport,
        arrival_airport=flight_data.metadata.arrival_airport
    ).point(
      flight_data.location.latitude, 
      flight_data.location.longitude
    )
```

Error handling, recovery, publishing metrics... 


## 3.2. Active Flight API

Our active flight API needs to return a continually updating list of active flights within a given bounding region, or bounding box. One way to accomplish this would be to continually "poll" an API endpoint for a list of active points in a region as needed, and stop when the data is no longer needed. However, this is inefficient for a number of reasons. While most modern HTTP clients are smart enough to keep connection pools open and manage them efficiently modern protocols allow for the opening of connections persistent connections that allow data to be "pushed" through as it gets updated. One such technology is called websockets and this is supported by `gRPC`. `gRPC` is a high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that allows services to communicate across different languages and platforms efficiently. It uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for serialization, supports bi-directional streaming, and is built on HTTP/2, enabling features like low-latency communication, multiplexing, and built-in support for authentication and load balancing. It allows us to define services interfaces for our features which our applications or microservices can then implement. 


```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package "flightstream";

service LiveFlightService {
    // Server streaming RPC for flight updates
    rpc StreamActiveFlights (BoundingBox) returns (stream FlightData) {}
}

message BoundingBox {
    double min_latitude = 1;
    double min_longitude = 2;
    double max_latitude = 3;
    double max_longitude = 4;
}

message FlightData {
  // As previously defined
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the gRPC Server with WebSocket Streaming

Below is the Python code to implement the gRPC server using `grpcio` and `websockets` libraries. It subscribes to Tile38’s real-time notifications and streams them to clients via WebSockets.

#### Implement the gRPC server and WebSocket

```python
import tile38
from flightstream_pb2_grpc import FlightServiceServicer 
from flightstream_pb2 import BoundingBox 
from flight_pb2 import FlightData

# Tile38 client
client = tile38.Tile38()

# The `flight_stream` async generator listens for Tile38 geofence notifications for flights
# within the bounding box and yields each flight update.
async def flight_stream(bounding_box: BoundingBox):
    min_lat, min_lon, max_lat, max_lon = bounding_box

    # Subscribe to Tile38 geofence events
    async for notification in client.within('active_flights')
      .bounds(min_lat, min_lon, max_lat, max_lon)
      # The `asFence()` method listens to geospatial events from Tile38, ensuring real-time updates when 
      # flights move into, out of, or change positions within the bounding box.
      .asFence()
      .exec():
        for obj in notification.get('object', []):
            flight_id = obj['id']
            lat = obj['coordinates'][1]
            lon = obj['coordinates'][0]
            altitude = obj.get('fields', {}).get('altitude', 0)
            airspeed = obj.get('fields', {}).get('airspeed', 0)
            timestamp = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ', time.gmtime())

            # Create Flight message to send over gRPC
            flight_data = FlightData(
                flight_id=flight_id,
                latitude=lat,
                longitude=lon,
                altitude=altitude,
                airspeed=airspeed,
                timestamp=timestamp,
                metadata={ ... }
            )
            yield flight_data

# We create a `FlightService` with a `StreamActiveFlights` method 
# that listens for bounding box updates and sends flight data back to the client.
class FlightService(flight_pb2_grpc.FlightServiceServicer):
    async def StreamActiveFlights(self, request, context):
        bbox = (request.min_lat, request.min_lon, request.max_lat, request.max_lon)
        async for flight in flight_stream(bbox):
            await context.write(flight)

# Create and start gRPC server
async def serve_grpc():
    server = grpc.aio.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10))
    flight_pb2_grpc.add_FlightServiceServicer_to_server(FlightService(), server)
    server.add_insecure_port('[::]:50051')
    await server.start()
    await server.wait_for_termination()

# WebSocket server to stream flight data
async def websocket_handler(websocket, path):
    # Define the bounding box (can be received via a WebSocket message)
    min_lat, min_lon, max_lat, max_lon = 30.0, -120.0, 40.0, -110.0
    bbox = (min_lat, min_lon, max_lat, max_lon)

    async for flight in flight_stream(bbox):
        # Send flight data over the WebSocket
        await websocket.send(f"Flight {flight.flight_id}: ({flight.latitude}, {flight.longitude}) at {flight.altitude} feet and {flight.airspeed} knots.")

# Start websocket server
async def start_websocket_server():
    async with websockets.serve(websocket_handler, ACTIVE_FLIGHT_DATA_HOST, 6789):
        await asyncio.Future()  # Run forever

# Main event loop to run both gRPC and WebSocket servers concurrently
async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(serve_grpc(), start_websocket_server())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## 3.3. Cleaner

For the final component of this feature, a cleanup task is essential to manage the removal of expired data. First, expired data can lead to inaccuracies which could cause a very poor user experience. Furthermore, it ensures that storage resources are optimized by preventing unnecessary accumulation of outdated information, which can lead to increased costs and reduced system performance. Without periodic removal of expired data, queries and indexing operations may slow down as the database grows unnecessarily large.
