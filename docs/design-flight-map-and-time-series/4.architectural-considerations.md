### 5. **Architectural Considerations**

#### 5.1 **Scalability**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Both the ingestion and storage layers are designed for horizontal scalability. Kafka partitions or Kinesis shards can handle increased load by distributing flight data across multiple nodes.
- **Load Balancing**: APIs are deployed behind a load balancer (e.g., Nginx or AWS ALB) to distribute client requests evenly across available nodes.

#### 5.2 **Latency**
- **Low-latency Storage**: The use of Redis and in-memory caching ensures that live flight data can be retrieved within 100 milliseconds. The in-memory data model is optimized for geospatial querying, minimizing the latency of the home screen flight map feature.

#### 5.3 **Fault Tolerance and Data Integrity**

- **Redundancy**: The system replicates data across multiple instances of Redis or the time series database to ensure high availability and prevent data loss in the event of node failure.
- **Backpressure**: The stream processing layer will implement backpressure handling to ensure that the system does not become overwhelmed during periods of high traffic or data volume.
